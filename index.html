<h1>LED Valentines: Build a light-up circuit</h1>
<h2><strong>Components</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Tiny breadboard</li>
<li aria-level="1">Battery (pre-mounted on the breadboard in pins E-6 &amp; F-13)</li>
<li aria-level="1">2 LEDs (1 steady red light, marked with red paint on the wire; 1 rainbow flashing light)</li>
<li aria-level="1">2 resistors (10 ohms - brown/black/black - gold; 47 ohms - green/purple/black - gold)</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Assembly Instructions</strong></h2>
<p>Lay out your pieces and make sure the battery is still attached to the board. Make sure you have two resistors, two LED bulbs, and a switch.</p>

<p>The location on the breadboard will be written as Column-Row. For example, Column D, Row 10 would be D-10</p>
<h4><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, add the LED lights. The LEDs have a short wire and a long wire:&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
<li>Put the long wire of the <strong>red LED</strong> into C-6 and the short wire into C-5</li>
<li>Put the long wire of the <strong>rainbow LED</strong> in B-6 and the short wire into B-7</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 2: Next, add the resistors. The 10 ohm resistor has a brown band. The 47 ohm resistor has a green band.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One wire of the 47-ohm resistor goes in column G-14</li>
<li>One wire of the 10-ohm resistor goes into column F-14</li>
<li>Now the two free wires of the resistors should be pointing up out of the board into the air</li>
<li>Bend the wires of the 47-ohm resistor over the battery so that the free end can fit into D-5.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Bend the wires of the 10-ohm resistor over until the free end can be inserted into A-7.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Be careful that the resistor wire is NOT resting against any other metal on the&nbsp;</em><em>battery or LEDs.</em></p>

<p> The resistors with one side attached is shown here.

<p>The breadboard with the LEDs and both resistors completely attached should look like the following image:</p>

<h4><strong>Step 3: Finally, add the switch.</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The three wires of the switch go into Column J, Rows 12, 13, and 14.</li>
<li>The orientation of the switch doesn&rsquo;t matter.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following circuit illustration can be used to identify if all of the components have been placed in the correct places.</p>
